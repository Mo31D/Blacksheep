# PHASE 0 — ARCHITECTURE LOCK

- [x] Create masterplan.
- [x] Freeze current 146-product source snapshot for migration.
- [x] Produce exact current-field inventory from assets/catalog.js.
- [x] Finalize product/variant schema.
- [x] Finalize category model.
- [x] Finalize media model.
- [x] Finalize supplier model.
- [x] Finalize inventory quantity semantics: on-hand / reserved / available / incoming.

Exit gate:
- schema approved,
- lifecycle approved,
- no ambiguous source-of-truth rules,
- no code path requires GitHub edits for routine owner product management.

**Status: COMPLETE — specification locked. No Product/Inventory migration has been created or applied.**

Exact Phase 1 start:
1. additive Product Core D1 migration,
2. deterministic importer,
3. staging-only import,
4. parity report,
5. read-only Products Admin.

---

# PHASE 1 — PRODUCT CORE / READ ONLY

- [x] Add D1 Product Core migration `0009_product_inventory_foundation.sql`.
- [x] Add normalized categories and deterministic default variants.
- [x] Build deterministic legacy catalogue importer.
- [x] Import all 146 current products into staging D1.
- [x] Achieve frozen-catalogue parity: **PASS, 0 mismatches**.
- [x] Add authenticated Product list/detail APIs.
- [x] Add premium Products workspace/search/filter/sort.
- [x] Deploy read-only Product Core to staging.
- [x] Verify Production remains untouched.
- [x] Owner iPhone QA completed from supplied screenshots.
- [x] Polish KPI cards to 2×2 mobile grid.
- [x] Correct Needs data from naive 28 to **15 unique actionable products**.

**Status: COMPLETE. Owner explicitly requested progression to Phase 2 after the mobile review/polish.**

Evidence:
- initial parity workflow: `36169256499`
- `docs/PRODUCT-CORE-STAGING-PARITY-2026-09-25.md`

- [x] Edit product basics: name / brand / type / description.
- [x] Edit price.
- [x] Edit SKU / barcode with uniqueness protection.
- [x] Edit categories.
- [x] Edit selling status.
- [x] Enable / disable online ordering.

- [x] Deploy Phase 2 Product Editor to staging.
- [x] Staging Product Core baseline guard: PASS.
- [x] Staging health/Admin shell: PASS.
- [x] Verify Production D1 remains `0000–0008`.

- [x] Archive product — non-destructive; sale disabled; audit retained.
- [x] Archived filter.
- [~] Owner mutation smoke-test in authenticated staging UI.

Current exit status:
- normal text / price / status / SKU / barcode / category edits no longer require GitHub on staging,
- Product editing remains isolated from the Production storefront,

Evidence:
- initial Phase 2 workflow `36172797078` / job `108196158387`
- Duplicate/Archive staging workflow `36174114456` / job `108200446776`
- current staging deployment `7984e631-902e-470b-bb0f-447bdb031b3b`
- current staging Worker version `cdcfe773-b6cc-4910-8c86-a74f28bde66c`

# PHASE 3 — PRODUCT MEDIA

- [!] Provision media storage — **external blocker:** Cloudflare account has not enabled R2; API error 10042: `Please enable R2 through the Cloudflare Dashboard.`
- [x] Staging-only R2 binding declared as `PRODUCT_MEDIA` / `black-sheep-product-media-staging`.
- [x] Secure authenticated multipart upload route implemented.
- [x] 8 MB upload limit.
- [x] JPEG / PNG / WebP allow-list.
- [x] Magic-byte/signature validation; MIME label alone is not trusted.
- [x] SHA-256 checksum captured.
- [x] Immutable media ID + R2 object-key design.
- [x] Same-origin immutable media delivery route `/media/<mediaId>`.
- [x] Media changes automatically create/use a Product Draft.
- [x] Product gallery manager implemented.
- [x] First uploaded image becomes Primary automatically.
- [x] Change Primary image.
- [x] Reorder gallery.
- [x] Edit alt text.
- [x] Remove image non-destructively from the Draft.
- [x] Preserve published-version media when Draft removes an image.
- [x] Avoid deleting shared R2 objects still referenced by another media row.
- [~] Replace image — implementing dedicated one-click replacement with D1-safe swap and R2 cleanup.
- [x] Product Media audit events.
- [x] Phase 3 Admin UI + upload-validation tests.
- [x] Immutable media-delivery route tests.
- [x] Full Commerce CI: **PASS** — run `36174836076`.
- [x] Dedicated `Product Media Staging Phase 3` deployment workflow with R2 existence gate.
- [ ] Deploy Product Media to staging — blocked until R2 is enabled and the staging bucket can be created.
- [!] iPhone photo upload QA — blocked until the same R2 activation.
- [~] Legacy-image coexistence — architecture supports `LEGACY_REPO` and `R2` together; live R2 E2E remains blocked.

Exit gate:
- owner can create a complete product including imagery from Admin,
- upload / primary / reorder / alt / remove proven on real staging R2,
- iPhone Photos/camera path visually verified.

**Current status: CODE-COMPLETE FOR CORE MEDIA FLOWS; STAGING RELEASE BLOCKED ONLY BY CLOUDFLARE R2 ACTIVATION.**

# CURRENT EXACT NEXT ACTION

## External action required once

Enable **R2 Object Storage** in the Cloudflare account.

The Cloudflare API currently returns:

`10042 — Please enable R2 through the Cloudflare Dashboard.`

Do **not** create a bucket manually unless desired. Once R2 is enabled, the next automated steps are:

1. Create isolated bucket `black-sheep-product-media-staging` in Western Europe.
2. Verify the staging-only `PRODUCT_MEDIA` binding.
3. Trigger `Product Media Staging Phase 3`.
4. Re-run full Commerce CI and Product Core safety gates.
5. Deploy Worker to staging only.
6. Upload one controlled image from iPhone.
7. Verify gallery / Primary / reorder / alt text / remove.
8. Verify Legacy + R2 image coexistence.
9. Dedicated one-click Replace is being completed in source now; live iPhone verification still waits for R2.

Production remains locked:
- Product Core migration `0009` is not applied to Production.
- Production Product Media/R2 is not configured.
- Inventory tracking remains disabled.
- storefront/checkout cutover remains a later phase.
